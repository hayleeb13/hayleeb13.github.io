  <p>Hello my name is Haylee Bell and this is my page. I am first and foremost a nerd and geek.
  I love everything from computers to math to comics to science fiction and everything in between.
  I wish I could say something super dazzling here that captured your attention and/or made you 
  laugh. However, I am socially awkward and that shows up in my writing as well apparently.</p>

  <p>More about who I am as a person. I am difficult and strong willed. I am stubborn and love a good
  challenge. Learning every day is one of my main goals in life. Being a student and working is a
  good way to achieve that goal. And hopefully after this course I will be a web designer.</p>
